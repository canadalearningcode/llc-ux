      #General Notes
      * **Important!**
      Please give learners enough time to download learner files from slide 1 - check in as people are entering the room to make sure they have **learner files, Marvel App & Chrome** ready so you can start the experience on time. Encourage them to ask yourself or a mentor for help with installation!
      * If learners don't have access to Marvel app or prefer not to download an app, they can use their paper prototypes for testing.
      * As the workshop has a lot of content, use quick 5-min breaks to give learners time to absorb / ask questions.
      * Give learners a heads-up on forming one group for all activites.
      * Activities 1+2 - For teams that can’t decide on one topic, encourage them to vote using sticky dots/markers on most workable idea out of 3 within the timeframe.

      #Specific Examples
      **Slide 10: What is User Experience Design?**

      Ask learners what each part means to them. Include some example answers.

      **Slide 11: Where did the term come from?**

      Before starting, ask: Any guesses how long the term ‘UX’ has been around?
      Ans: Since 1995!

      **Slide 13: What goes into UX?**

      Note to learners that this is high level and we will go more into detail later throughout the workshop.

      **Slide 15: Good and Bad UX Examples**

      Ask: Why is this a good or bad experience?

      * Mailchimp (Good) - Ensures that you are responsible for your account deletion
      * Facebook (Bad) **How could it be improved?**
        * Educating user why update is important (e.g. why update, how much time it’ll take, not forcing the update). Forcing update is annoying and could be a life or death situation (urgent msg).

      **Slide 25: How UX and UI compliment each other**

      ###Heinz Ketchup Bottle

      * Ketchup’s changing user experience is a great example of how we have influenced the experience of holding the bottle to squeezing the ketchup out.
      * In 1869, the 1st transparent glass bottle was designed to see the purity of the ketchup through the bottle. (UI)
      * In 2002, the 2nd upside-down bottle was designed to address the need to press less for squeezing, avoid mess and wastage. (UX)

      **Slide 27: The Design Cycle**

      * Workshop will focus on **Design Sprint** sections.

      **Slide 34: Examples of User Research methods**

      ###Ask / Explain The 5 Whys to learners
      * Eg. Who has a pet peeve? or Who finds online shopping hard?
      * 1st why: Why do you have X pet peeve? Because of M.
      * 2nd why: Why is M making it a pet peeve? Because of N.
      * 3rd why: Why is N a problem? Because of Z.
      * 4th why: Why hasn't Z been resolved?
      * 5th why: Z has not been resolved because... - This is the root cause.

      ###Engage with extreme users
        * People who exhibit pronounced traits of your regular users (ie. Professional users).
        * People with limitations or use workarounds (ie. Those with disability, language barriers, age differences).
      ### Roleplay
        * Put yourself in the shoes of your user and imagine their day to day.

      ###Storytelling or Roleplaying - Following a user journey
      * What is the first thing you do when you get groceries? Then what? (including things we do unconsciously like grabbing our wallet, locking the door). This is the user journey you take before, during and after getting groceries!

      ###Affinity mapping image (3rd example) is choosing a restaurant
      * Point out briefly how choosing a restaurant includes considerations eg. Price, quality, reviews, speed, delivery.

      **Slide 40: Group Activity 1 - Class Brainstorming**

      1. Learners form teams of 3-5 (depending on class size). They will be working in these teams for whole workshop.

      1. Instructor prompts workshop learners to come up with 3-5 common problems /frustrations they face. Vote for 1 relevant issue to work on.

      **Slide 41: Group Activity 2 - Persona**

      1. Give out blank persona templates.

      1. Each team comes up with 1 persona. Have learners create it from their own experiences and perspective (Keeping in mind we will be sharing these).

      1. Give option of using persona template to organize ideas after brainstorming, or stick to sticky notes.

      **Slides 50: Prototyping Activity 4**
      Set aside time for learners to install the Marvel Pop app and create an account.

      Instructor & Mentors should assist learners on using Marvel.

      **Slides 55 - 59: User Testing parts 1 & 2**

      Focus on this content and the questions to ask for user testing, since learners will be testing their designs. Part 3 - Wrapping up can be skimmed over quickly.

      **Slide 63: Activity 5 - User Testing**

      10 mins - Each learner group tests their prototype with their neighbouring group.
      10 mins - Switch after 10 mins. Each group can test with 2 neighbouring groups.
      **Tell learners that they will be wrapping up their findings and nominate 1 volunteer to share during presentation.**

      **Slide 66: Presentations**

      **Slide 68 - 82: Ethics**

      If short on time, jump to slide 74: How does Ethics go with Equity?

      **Slide 77: Does this situation seem familiar?**

      Stop video at **30 seconds**.

      **Slide 78: Ethics: What do the following have in common?**

      They represent our subconscious biases.
