      #Learning Goals
      ##In this workshop, we will cover:
        * How User Experience Design affects our lives in both good and bad ways.
        * How User Experience (UX) and User Interface (UI) design go hand in hand.
        * How different experiences like genders, cultures, languages, and backgrounds shape how we use technology daily.
        * How to collaborate with team members to solve a real-world problem.
        * The responsibility and decisions between user and designer when it comes to behaviours and to practice good digital citizenship.
        * How to give constructive design feedback.

      Equity means fairness. Equity ensures everyone gets what they need to improve their situation. Ideally, we should be working towards **liberation**, and equity is a temporary solution as we work towards this.

    Don Norman, a cognitive scientist and co-founder of the Nielsen Norman Group Design Consultancy, coined the term in 1995 declaring that <b>‚ÄúUser experience encompasses all aspects of the end-user‚Äôs interaction with the company, its services, and its products.‚Äù</b>

      * <!-- .element: class="delayed" -->A prototype is a **rudimentary representation** of how the product will look and/or work. Prototypes are meant to be created with **minimal effort** to be improvised on quickly.
      * <!-- .element: class="delayed" -->It can be a paper prototype, or a more interactive digital prototype.

      #Why prototypes?

      ###Prototypes allow fast validation of ideas ‚úî <!-- .element: class="delayed" -->

      * Since prototypes are created with minimal effort, any changes to the design or functionality can be addressed quickly.<!-- .element: class="delayed" -->
      This process fosters rapid idea generation and validation.

      ###Prototypes save time and money üí∞‚åõ <!-- .element: class="delayed" -->

      * Misunderstandings can be identified and addressed as early in the design process as possible. The earlier in the process issues are addressed, the better, saving you and your team time and money.<!-- .element: class="delayed" -->

      ###Prototypes help involve everyone in the design process üë®üèæ‚Äçüíªüë©üèª‚Äçüíª <!-- .element: class="delayed" -->

      * Even a modest project will typically include a number of different stakeholders. It‚Äôs important to engage with everyone involved in a project, bringing them on the journey from idea to finished product.<!-- .element: class="delayed" -->

       * Wireframes let us **simplify the interface** using shapes and layout, and are helpful for communicating high-level structure.
       * Using colour is **optional** for low - medium fidelity wireframes.

      #What is designing for accessibility?
        <p class="delayed">In practice, accessibility is about designing for users with disabilities. Philosophically, it is about *designing for everyone*.
        </p>

      ##Why design for accessibility?<!-- .element: class="delayed" -->
      * By designing for as many people as possible, the design and product reaches a wider usage.<!-- .element: class="delayed" -->
      * It reframes public perception and reduces stigmas surrounding user barriers. <!-- .element: class="delayed" -->
      * Challenges designers and provides unique UX insights.<!-- .element: class="delayed" -->
